# Useful scripts for personal purposes

Note that I use zsh...

## Use them
```
git clone git@github.com:Pamplemousse/scripts.git
mv scripts ~/scripts
source ~/scripts/lib/*
```

## Tests
These scripts had been developed using TDD with the [shunit2](https://shunit2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/source/2.1/doc/shunit2.html) framework to write shell tests.

To launch the tests suite:

```
./spec/*
```
